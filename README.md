# hifzhelper

an app to help people trying to do Hifz ul Quran. Written for IOS in Swift

## motivation

I'm a father, currently trying to help his son learn the Quran. he has learnt a few chapters, but now is struggling with his historical chapters (manzil). I'm trying to find patterns and track progress so our revisions can become much more efficient, but since we use a paper quran, the annotations become very convoluted and hard to follow.

That has made me look towards an IOS app on the ipad to help with this... this project is a labor of love. 

## notes:

- pulling pages from: http://www.equranschool.com/quranreading/002_bqr_003_007.htm

- a good conversation with the Quran IOS app owner, where he's given tips on areas to extend the app to it can be used for tracking hifz memorization:
